# hello-world
first repository... still not sure what that means...

I am just doing this a for a class. I don't even know how to code very well...
I really like video games... May play around with programming but will probably end up just doing game art.

What? Why are my edits not showing up in the pull requests?!?!?!?!?!?!?! ARGHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
